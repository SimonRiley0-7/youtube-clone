# AWS Workshop Patterns Implementation for YouTube Clone

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Based on AWS Workshop Patterns

Based on the [AWS workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/3de93ad5-ebbe-4258-b977-b45cdfe661f1/en-US), I'll implement the following patterns:

### 1. **Multi-Tier Architecture**
- **Presentation Tier**: Frontend (Static files served via S3 + CloudFront)
- **Application Tier**: EC2 instances running Node.js
- **Data Tier**: RDS PostgreSQL database
- **Storage Tier**: S3 for video/thumbnail storage

### 2. **High Availability Design**
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for RDS
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for EC2
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution
- **Health checks** and monitoring

### 3. **Security Best Practices**
- **VPC with private subnets** for application and database
- **Security groups** with least privilege access
- **IAM roles** instead of access keys
- **Encryption** at rest and in transit

### 4. **Free Tier Optimization**
- **t2.micro instances** for EC2 and RDS
- **Single AZ** for cost optimization
- **Minimal resource allocation**
- **Usage monitoring** and alerts

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. VPC with public/private subnets
2. Security groups and NACLs
3. Internet Gateway and Route Tables
4. RDS in private subnet
5. EC2 in private subnet with ALB

### Phase 2: Application Deployment
1. Code deployment to EC2
2. Database setup and migration
3. S3 bucket configuration
4. Load balancer configuration

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Optimization
1. CloudWatch monitoring
2. Auto Scaling configuration
3. Health checks and alerts
4. Cost optimization

## üìã Workshop Pattern Compliance

### ‚úÖ **Following AWS Workshop Standards:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** approach
- **Security-first** design
- **Cost-optimized** for Free Tier
- **Production-ready** architecture
- **Best practices** implementation
